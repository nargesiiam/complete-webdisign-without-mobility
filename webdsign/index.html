                    TERN wasn’t built to chase AI trends; it was created to solve a real problem. Co-founder and former
                    special operator Brett Harrison first saw the danger of contested GPS signals during military
                    operations in
                    Afghanistan. Seeing those vulnerabilities grow from daily frustrations to national
                    security risks, he partnered with AI entrepreneur Shaun Moore, who led a team to built the world’s
                    fastest facial recognition system. Together, they united professional navigators and top-tier AI
                    engineers to create IDPS™, a signal-independent navigation system born from lived experience, not
                    theory. That foundation, paired with a culture of creative empowerment and mission-first thinking,
                    has enabled TERN to deliver a combat proven and U.S. Department of Transportation tested,
                    infrastructure-free alternative to GPS that is already reshaping how the world navigates.

                    Driven by a love of exploration and innovation, Shaun previously founded the company Trueface, which
                    focused on teaching cameras to see as human beings. That company, which Shaun ran for nine years,
                    was operated based on three core principles: Humanity First, Data Security, and Total Transparency.
                    Shaun sold Trueface to Pangiam in May of 2021 and joined Pangiam as a Board of Director and Chief AI
                    Officer. Shaun is a well respected thought leader in AI and has spoken around the world about
                    responsible adoption of the ever-evolving technology. He holds three patents in the AI space, was
                    named a semi-finalist for Ernst and Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year Award in LA in 2019 and in 2020
                    was named Analytics Insight 40 under 40 Innovators in 2019. He was also a finalist for the FedScoop
                    50 Awards for Industry Leadership. Shaun holds a BAA in Finance from Southern Methodist.
